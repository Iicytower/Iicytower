### Hi there :bangbang:


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [obj-valid](https://github.com/Iicytower/obj-valid).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Send me e-mail. Adress is in profile.
- ðŸ˜„ Language: 011000100111011101100010011101000110010001110011011010100111001001110101.
