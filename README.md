### Hi there :bangbang:


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [obj-valid](https://github.com/Iicytower/obj-valid).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Send me e-mail. Adress is in profile.
- ðŸ˜„ Language: 011000100111011101100010011101000110010001110011011010100111001001110101.
- :tada: Fun fact: I would like to make an [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) based robot and I will definitely do it someday.
- :+1: Love in JS: `null` value is absolutely awesome and possibility to use dynamic typing(js) and static typing(ts)
- :-1: Not love in JS: `'` and `"` one way to declare strings is enough, but it can't be deleted :cry:. 
- :rage: Hate in JS: This language is too liberal to developer mistakes. If you want, you can use `;` if not you have no obligation, and more. But again backward compatibility say: "HAHAHA!"
