### Hi there :bangbang:


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [obj-valid](https://github.com/Iicytower/obj-valid).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Send me e-mail. Adress is in profile.
- ðŸ˜„ Main language: 011000100111011101100010011101000110010001110011011010100111001001110101.
- :tada: Fun fact: I would like to make an [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) based robot and I will definitely do it someday.
- :+1: Love in JS: `null` value is absolutely awesome and possibility to use dynamic typing(js) and static typing(ts)
- :-1: Not love in JS: `'` and `"`. One way to declare strings is enough, but backward compatibility does not allow to delete it :cry:. 
- :rage: Hate in JS: This language is too liberal to developer mistakes. If you want, you can use `;` if not you have no obligation, and more. But backward compatibility say: "HAHAHA!"
- :computer: Technologies and libraries: `Javascript and Typescript`, `Node.js`, `Express.js`, `MySQL`, `MongoDB`, `Sequelize`, `Mongoose`, `JWT`, `Passport`, `REST`, `Linux`, `Git/GitHub`, `HTML`, `CSS`, `SASS`, `Docker`, `bash/zsh`
- :closed_book: Languages: Polish(native), Russian(native), English(enough to read and write documentation +)
- Currently I'm actively looking for my first job as Node.j developer.
