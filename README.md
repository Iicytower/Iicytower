### Hi there :bangbang:


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently look for new experiences and challenges. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about prompt engineering.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Send me an e-mail. Address is in profile.
- ðŸ˜„ Main language: `++++++++++[>+>+++>+++++++>++++++++++<<<<-]>>>++++.>---.+++++++++++++++++++++.---------------------.++++++++++++++++++.----------------.+++++++++++++++.---------.+++++++.++++.`. 
- :tada: Curiosity: I would like to make an [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) based robot and I will definitely do it someday.
- :+1: Love in JS: Possibility to use dynamic typing(js) and static typing(ts) and the universality of this language.
<!-- - :-1: Not love in JS: `'` and `"`. One way to declare strings is enough, but backward compatibility does not allow to delete it :cry:.  -->
- :rage: Hate in JS: This language is too indulgent towards developer mistakes. For example, if you want, you can use `;`, but you have no obligation to.
- :computer: Technologies and libraries: `Javascript` `Typescript` `Node.js` `Express.js` `NestJS` `MySQL` `MongoDB` `Mongoose` `JWT` `REST` `GraphQL` `Linux` `Docker` `bash` `Git` `HTML` `CSS`  and some more
- :closed_book: Languages: Polish(native), Russian(fluent), English(comunicative)
