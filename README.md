### Hi there :bangbang:


- 🔭 I’m currently look for new experiences and challenges. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
- 📫 How to reach me: Send me an e-mail. Address is in profile.
- 😄 Main language: 011000100111011101100010011101000110010001110011011010100111001001110101.

- :tada: Curiosity: I would like to make an [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) based robot and I will definitely do it someday.
- :+1: Love in JS: `null` value is absolutely awesome! and possibility to use dynamic typing(js) and static typing(ts)
<!-- - :-1: Not love in JS: `'` and `"`. One way to declare strings is enough, but backward compatibility does not allow to delete it :cry:.  -->
- :rage: Hate in JS: This language is too indulgent towards developer mistakes. For example, if you want, you can use `;`, but you have no obligation to.
- :computer: Technologies and libraries: `Javascript` `Typescript` `Node.js` `Express.js` `NestJS` `MySQL` `MongoDB` `Mongoose` `JWT` `Passport` `REST` `Linux` `Git` `HTML` `CSS` `SASS` `Docker` `bash`
  * I know a bit `TypeORM` `Jenkins` `Sequelize`
- :closed_book: Languages: Polish(native), Russian(very good), English(comunicative)
