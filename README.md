### Hi there :bangbang:


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [obj-valid](https://github.com/Iicytower/obj-valid).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).
- :rocket: I would like to learn `Socket.io` `GraphQL` `Jest` `microservices` `Prisma` `vim` and a lot more.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Send me an e-mail. Address is in profile.
- ðŸ˜„ Main language: 011000100111011101100010011101000110010001110011011010100111001001110101.

- :tada: Curiosity: I would like to make an [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) based robot and I will definitely do it someday.
- :+1: Love in JS: `null` value is absolutely awesome! and possibility to use dynamic typing(js) and static typing(ts)
- :-1: Not love in JS: `'` and `"`. One way to declare strings is enough, but backward compatibility does not allow to delete it :cry:. 
- :rage: Hate in JS: This language is too indulgent towards developer mistakes. For example, if you want, you can use `;`, but you have no obligation to. But backward compatibility says: "HAHAHA!"
- :computer: Technologies and libraries: `Javascript` `Typescript` `Node.js` `Express.js` `MySQL` `MongoDB` `Sequelize` `Mongoose` `JWT` `Passport` `REST` `Linux` `Git/GitHub` `HTML` `CSS` `SASS` `Docker` `bash/zsh`
  * I know a bit `NestJS` `TypeORM`
- :closed_book: Languages: Polish(native), Russian(very good), English(enough to read and write documentation +)
